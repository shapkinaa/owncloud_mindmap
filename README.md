Install:
- Download and extract the MindMap files in folder '<%owncloud_webroot%>/apps/mindmap/'.
- Enable the ownCloud app in the ownCloud web admin section
- Disable CSP in owncloud config.php (read Known Issue nr1. See below)
- Create Text file with extension .json. 


Known Issue:
1. When opening Mindmap in Firefox, Chrome, eg a blank page with no Mindmap application. This is due to the webbrowser Content-Security-Policy (CSP). CSP is enabled in the lateste webbrowsers.
There are two solutions to this issue:

Option1. In firefox you can disable CSP. Open in address bar 'about:config' and search for 'security.csp.enable' and turn it off.

Option2. Global disable CSP on the owncloud webserver. This can be disabled by adding the custom_csp_policy in the owncloud config.php.


Place these lines in the $CONFIG Array section in the http://[YOURSERVER]/config/config.php file

$CONFIG = array (...

...

/* Custom CSP policy, changing this will overwrite the standard policy */
'custom_csp_policy' => "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; frame-src *; img-src *; font-src 'self' data:; media-src *",

...

);
